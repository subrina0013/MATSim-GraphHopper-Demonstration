This is a demonstration of the research work on evaluating the efficacy of shortest path routing for approximating complex traffic pattern

The primary focus of this study is on assessing the viability of a fast, shortest path routing system as a method for traffic modeling. Key metrics include travel time accuracy, congestion levels, similarity in corresponding routes, Vehicle Miles Traveled, and average spending time on road. By analyzing these factors, we assess the degree to which the shortest path routing approach can approximate actual traffic conditions.
